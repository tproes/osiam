/**
 * <p>org.osiam is the main package of OSIAM it is divided in three packages:</p>
 *
 * <p>org.osiam.storage - contains all specific storage packages</p>
 *
 * <p>org.osiam.resources - contains all resource server specific packages</p>
 *
 * <p>org.osiam.security - contains all security related packages.</p>
 *
 * <p>Currently (July 2013) we offer you the developer version of OSIAM. The next steps for 2013 are the implementation
 * and hardening of the security features and the enhancement of OSIAM's usability.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more information on the roadmap visit https://osiam.org</p>
 *
 * <p>OSIAM was developed having in mind the identity data leaks from websites and companies that are getting published
 * each week. OSIAM will provide a secure yet easy to handle identity store with additional handy features.
 * OSIAM adheres to open standards. Specifically OSIAM implements OAuth2 and SCIMv2 (still in IETF draft).</p>
 *
 * <p>Beside that OSIAM will offer enhanced functionality for managing identity and identity related data, also
 * implementing specific security features to raise the burden against external and internal threats as high
 * as possible.</p>
